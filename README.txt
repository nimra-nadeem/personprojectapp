This repository contains 3 things:

1. A document containing my responses to the questions asked for 
   the person project programmer job application
2. A basic todo app that I implemented using JavaScript and React
3. My research project from Spring 2020 where I compared the effect 
   of single-reward v. multi-reward functions on objective fitness 
   functions in a fully deterministic reinforcement learning environment. 
   The folder contains my write up explaining the research and results, 
   plus pdfs of the python notebooks I used for my data analysis and visualization.
